# Robotic-Surgery-Dynamics-Sim
An unforced robotic surgery dynamics simulation modeled via a 2D triple inverted pendulum with holonomic fixed entry and linear actuator end effector using both a DAE and Euler-Lagrange approach. My final project for MAE 5730: Intermediate Dynamics


## Instructions
To use the matlab script go to Robotic_Surgery_Instrument and click run

To read my report on the simulation, go to Robotic Surgery Dynamics Simulation.pdf in the repository

To see an animation of the final simulation at Robotic Surgery Dynamics Simulation (Animation Gif)
